# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Deactivate the virtual environment (when done)
deactivate



Differences Between "python -m pip install ." and requirements.txt:
python -m pip install .: This installs the package defined in the current directory
 (typically using the setup.py or pyproject.toml file), along with its dependencies as 
 specified in those configuration files.

Used when you are installing the package you are developing.
Installs dependencies defined within the package's configuration.
requirements.txt: This installs external packages listed in the file.

Typically used for setting up the environment with the correct dependencies.
Ensures all dependencies are installed in the correct versions for the project to run properly.
The Key Difference:
requirements.txt is used to install external packages (like pandas) that your project depends on.
pip install . is used to install your own project as a package (along with its dependencies,
 like pandas) so that you or others can run your project.

'''reviews_vector_chain.combine_documents_chain.llm_chain.prompt = review_prompt '''
Default Prompt: When you create the reviews_vector_chain using RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(), 
it automatically uses a default prompt for the language model. This prompt is part of the internal
 logic of the chain and is used unless you explicitly change it.

Explicit Override: Even though you define review_prompt separately, the chain doesn’t 
automatically know to use it. 
By writing reviews_vector_chain.combine_documents_chain.llm_chain.prompt = review_prompt, 
you are explicitly telling the chain, "Use my custom prompt (review_prompt) instead of the default one."
